I created this for my own use, but there may be others who take this idea and improve it. I built it entirely using ChatGPT, and some code may be unnecessary, but I didnâ€™t remove it. I will update it again later.

Working principle: It uses a class to find the URLs of images, performs OCR on those images, then translates and replaces the URLs with the new translated images

# Needed
1. google chrome
2. install [Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf) and trun on
3. Api [google key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
4. CSS selector (It cannot be used with websites that use blobs. The image search is done in the same way as uBlock)\
   [ `id="image-container"` | `#image-container` ]\
   [ `class="image-container"` | `.image-container` ]\
   [ `[class="image-container"] > img` | `.image-container img` ]

I haven't tested it on many websites yet.\
Make sure to turn off `Allow CORS: Access-Control-Allow-Origin` every time after you are not using this extension.
